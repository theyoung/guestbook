## Getting Started

This example requires that you have forked the repository and [fired up a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes#contents.

On some setups, this can be as easy as running:
```shell
 $ cd kubernetes
 $ hack/dev-build-and-up.sh
``` 

For others, there are also many other ways to set up a kubernetes cluster.  For comprehensive directions on setting up, see the getting started guides [Getting Started Guides](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/tree/master/docs/getting-started-guides).
